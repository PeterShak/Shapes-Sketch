  What really challenged me during this process was figuring out how to make the beginshape, vertex, and endshape work. Eventually, I think I managed to get it all sorted out, but it took quite some time to get used to and understand how it worked. The second thing that I struggled with was the arcs. I went into a seperate p5 page to figure out how they worked. The vertexs and arcs are still confusing to me and will require more use to truly understand how they work because I'm still a little bit lost. I feel like whenever I put a vertex in a spot, it doesn't do what I want it to do and I have to basically do trial and error until I get it in the place I want. This is also how it feels like with the arcs. I try to put the shape in a spot, but it never wants to go to that spot, so I have to trial and error it until it finally works. In class, next time I have some free time, I will put on some music and try to just get the arcs to go to the spots that I want them to; and I will keep doing this until they work how I want them to. Same with the begin and end shape. I will keep working on them until I get them to go to the right spots and have no more issues with them. I am proud of my finished product. I like to put time and effort into all my sketches because the better the sketch is, the easier it will be to put it into code later. That's why I always try to spend time on every single shape, going over each point two or three times to make sure I put in the coordinates right and to make sure taht it all lines up to the best of my ability. And even though I did have to change some of the points to make them work right, the finished product is exactly how I have it drawn on my piece of paper.
