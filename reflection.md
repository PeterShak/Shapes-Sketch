  What really challenged me during this process was figuring out how to make the beginshape, vertex, and endshape work. Eventually, I think I managed to get it all sorted out, 
  but it took quite some time to get used to and understand how it worked. The second thing that I struggled with was the arcs. I went into a seperate p5 page to figure out how 
  they worked. The vertexs and arcs are still confusing to me and will require more use to truly understand how they work because I'm still a little bit lost. I am proud of my 
  finished product. I made it exactly how I had it drawn on my paper, even though I did have to change some of the points to make them work right.
